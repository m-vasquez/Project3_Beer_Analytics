### Machine Learning and Big Data Project Proposal:
Our goal is to help find your new favorite beer...or two! Using big data, we aim to give the user more insight on their favorite beers, as well as use machine learning to predict potential new favorites based on current beer preferences.

## [Beer Deep Dive App](https://beer-d.herokuapp.com/)

**Model:** For our analysis we are taking a dataset of over 1 million beers and creating an app for all you beer-lovers to use to learn more about the oldest alcoholic drink in the world. Using Python Libraries - Pandas and Matplotlib - as well as Tableau, we create visualizations to giver the user a better idea of the makings of their favorite beer(s). Next, we will use Scikit-Learn to create an analysis and by way of KMeans (predict) recommend beers to try. Lastly, we will return to Python land and use a Flask API to run our application, with the help of SQL and SQLAlchemy, HTML, and Javascript. You can find our app on Heroku.
